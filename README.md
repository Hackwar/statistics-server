# Joomla Environment Stats

In order to better understand our install base and end user environments, this plugin has been created to send
those stats back to a Joomla controlled central server. No worries though, __no__ identifying data is captured
at any point, and most data is dumped every 12 hours, after analysis and stat storage.
